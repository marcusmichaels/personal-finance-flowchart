# Personal Finance Flowchart

Inspired by the original r/UKPersonalFinance flowchart (https://i.imgur.com/BfHzwr9.png)

This aims to be an open source, interactive, and mobile-friendly version of that flowchart that the community can contribute to and keep up to date.

Have an idea? Joint the conversation on the r/UKPersonalFinance thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/7fui6i/interactive_ukpersonalfinance_flowchart/
